# A NeighborSchool Map App
This is a little map for searching informations of selected schools in wuhan, a city of China.<br>
I wrote this one-page application using KnockOut js framework. It works on mobile too.<br>
Open http://zvdifo.github.io/P5-neighborhoodMap/ and have fun!<br>

##How I finish it
* Download the Knockout framework.
* Write code required to add a full-screen map to page using the Google Maps API.
* Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of interested locations within the neighborhood.
* Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
* Implement a list view of the identified locations.
* Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc).
